# BokehBall

BokehBall is a module for [Omeka S](https://omeka.org/s/) allows you to jump to the bokeh resource page using the resource's `koha:biblionumber` property.

## Rationale

This is a module that allows you to jump to the bokeh resource page using the resource's `koha:biblionumber` property. This can be done by adding a property of your choice or via a resource page block.

## Requirements

* Omeka S >= 4.0.0

## Quick start

1. [Add the module to Omeka S](https://omeka.org/s/docs/user-manual/modules/#adding-modules-to-omeka-s)
2. Login to the admin interface, configure it.
3. Go to update job or add a resource page block.

## Features

After configuring your module with the URL of your Bokeh instance's resource page, you can update the property of your choice with the bounce via the module-specific job or add a resource page block that will integrate the bounce.
